# Balda
*Linguistic boardgame for 2 people using one controller*

**Rules from [The Critical Tinkerer](http://criticaltinkerer.blogspot.com/2015/10/balda-russian-pen-and-paper-game-of.html)**: The game is played on a 5x5 grid, which is seeded by a random five-letter word written across the middle (BALDA). 
Players then take turns adding a single letter to an empty cell, such that a new word can be produced. 
The word must be read by moving along a chain of spaces which are horizontally or vertically connected (no diagonals), 
cannot use any letter twice and must involve the letter the player has added (but doesn't have to start or end there). The length of the word
determines the number of points the player gets. Player can pass the turn without losing points. The player with the most points wins.

The game flow:
- select an empty cell on the field;
- select needed letter from the alphabet;
- select the word and press submit;
- if selected word exists player gets points and second player can start the flow from the start.
